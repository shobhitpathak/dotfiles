# Dotfiles repo

This repo houses the various dotfiles and other assorted configuration files that comprise my Linux installation. Effort is made to have all files reside in ~/.config, which is usually accomplished through aliasing a program command to include a specific path to configuration.

Obviously, take care when using these files. I make no claim that they will work on any system but my own--and sometimes, not even then.
